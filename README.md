Modern and retro-fitted homes aim to minimise energy usage by incorporating high levels of insulation and air-tightness. This can produces issues of:
-Stagnant Air with high CO2 levels and condensation Mechanical Heat Recovery(MHR) 

Systems:
- extract air from moisture producing rooms such as kitchens and bathrooms - inject fresh air into bedrooms and living areas, and
- use a heat-exchanger to retain over 80% of the heat of the expelled air


Currently, most such systems concentrate on the mechanical elements and provide minimal control to account for variations in individual rooms. Furthermore, the MHR systems are rarely integrated with the building heating system.

My proposed system aims to monitor heat and humidity in each room and control: - overall MHR system motor speed,
- individual room vent opening(two states)
- heating system control

The system will provide an app interface to allow the status of the building to be monitored and controlled remotely. The app will also show appropriate trends and charts.
